            <p>
                The Warrior is a tank oriented hero.<br>
                He can tank damage really well due to his<br>
                starting item,the broken seal, which can be <br>
                attached to armor giving him bouns armor and <br>
                can also transfer upgrades and glyphs
            </p>

        <h2>Rogue</h2>
        <img id="Img" src="img/Rogue.jpg" alt="Rogue" width="370" height="400">
        <div class="paragraph">
            <p>
                The Rogue is a melee burst hero. He can <br>
                easily one-shot enemies with his subclass <br> 
                asssasin. He also has another subclass just <br>
                for kiting enemies as well. He starts with a <br>
                invisibility cloak, which is argueably the <br>
                best artifact in the game.

        <h2>Mage</h2>
        <img id="Img" src="img/Mage.jpg" alt="Mage" width="370" height="400">
        <div class="paragraph">
            <p>
                The Mage is a magic based hero. Since magic <br>
                damage is calculated differently from normal <br>
                damage and can never miss, he has a very powerful<br>
                early game. He starts with a staff of magic missile,<br>
                which has the some of the weakest base damage, not <br>
                including Prismatic light and Transfusion
            </p>

        <h2>Huntress</h2>

        <div class="paragraph">
            <p>
                The Huntress is a ranged dps hero. She starts with<br>
                a spirit bow which has unlimited ammunition, making it <br>
                a powerful ranged weapon. Sadly, she has a poor early game<br>
                because of the spirit bow's poor scaling for damage even <br>
                she only needs a few win conditions.
